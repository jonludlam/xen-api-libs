Description: Fork-and-exec daemon for xapi
 The Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) is an open source enterprise-ready server
 virtualization and cloud computing platform, delivering the Xen Hypervisor
 with support for a range of guest operating systems.
 .
 This daemon is the fork-and-exec daemon used by xapi. When xapi requires
 another executable to be run, rather than forking and execing itself, it
 uses this single-threaded daemon to do it, passing fds to it as required.
